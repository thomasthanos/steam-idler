## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 18, npm ≥ 9, Steam running & logged in.

> `steamworks.js` is a native addon — Steam must be running before Electron starts.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # development (HMR)
npm run build      # compile only
npm run release    # build + installer (output: release/)
```

## 🔑 Steam Account (Auto-Invisible)

Optional login to enable automatic status management:

- **QR Code** — scan with the Steam mobile app
- **Cookie** — paste your `steamLoginSecure` cookie (`steamId||<jwt>` format supported)
- Refresh token is saved (base64-obfuscated) and used for auto-reconnect on next launch
- Status changes use the `steam://friends/status/` protocol — no CM traffic, no session conflicts
- Current persona state is read from `localconfig.vdf` before switching to Invisible, then restored on stop
