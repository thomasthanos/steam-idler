# Steam Achievement Manager — Quick Start

## 1. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

## 2. Start development (3 terminals)
```
Terminal 1:  npm run dev:main      (compiles main process, watch mode)
Terminal 2:  npm run dev:renderer  (Vite HMR server on :3000)
Terminal 3:  npm run electron      (launches Electron)
```

## 3. Build for production
```
npm run build
npm run package
```
Installer appears in /release

## ⚠️ Requirements
- Steam must be RUNNING before launching the app
- Node.js >= 18

## Notes on steamworks.js
The native module binds directly to the Steam client process.
AppId 480 (Spacewar) is used as fallback during development.
To test with a real game, launch the game from Steam first,
then select it in the Games tab.
